## Project Summary

Wellify is a desktop application that applies posture detection and emotion tracking to a users webcam feed to provide them with real-time notifications aimed at improving their health. Users can be notified when they are slouching, as well as when it would be a good time to take a break and stand up / look away from the screen.

## Install

To run this project, the repo must be cloned in your local directory.

This project relies on [node](http://nodejs.org) and MySQL for the back-end, and uses Typescript, React and Electron for the front-end.
