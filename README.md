## Project Summary

Wellify is a desktop application that applies posture detection and emotion tracking to a users webcam feed to provide them with real-time notifications aimed at improving their health. Users can be notified when they are slouching, as well as when it would be a good time to take a break and stand up / look away from the screen.
